  - {} creates list. Constant sections factored out as optimisation. e.g.
    {1 2 3 a 4 5 6 b} => {1 2 3} a cons {4 5 6} append b cons
    
    also for maps. Ordering isn't important here.
    #{:a 1 :b b :c 2} => #{:a 1 :c 2} :b b insert

  - memory pool for cons cells/tree nodes etc.
    Generic memory for strings etc. (copying collector?)
